  Pretend that each 24 hour period is actually an entire year with seasons.
  UTC hour 0 is Jan 1, winter.
  UTC hour 6 is the first day of spring, etc.
  Give each of these hours a pretty name related to the season it's in.
  These "seasonal hours" will be synchronized for everyone around the world
  because they use UTC time.

  Hour names were brainstormed in this spreadsheet
